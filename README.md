# 🚨 End-to-End Fraud Detection System with MLOps

A production-style **Machine Learning + MLOps** project that demonstrates the full lifecycle of an ML system — from raw data ingestion to deployment, monitoring, and automated retraining.

This project is built to reflect **real-world engineering practices**, not just notebook experiments.

---

## 📌 What this project shows

* How to build a **complete ML pipeline**
* How to track experiments with **MLflow**
* How to deploy models with **FastAPI**
* How to log predictions in production
* How to detect **data drift**
* How to trigger **automated retraining**
* How to manage ML projects the **industry way**

## 📮 Example Prediction

POST `/predict`

```json
{
  "features": [0.13, 0.44, 1.02, ...]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "fraud_probability": 0.73,
  "fraud_prediction": 1,
  "latency_sec": 0.42
}
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Drift Detection

```bash
python src/monitoring/drift_check.py
```

Output:

```
reports/drift_report.txt
```

Contains:

* Drift detected or not
* Feature checked
* Monitoring status

---

## 🔁 Automated Retraining

```bash
python src/retraining/retrain_pipeline.py
```

What it does:

1. Reads drift report
2. If drift detected → retrains models
3. Logs new run in MLflow
4. Registers new model version
